# The Future Anglo-German War Will Transform into an Armed Conflict Between Two Groups of Powers

## By Pyotr Nikolayevich Durnovo, February 1914

The central factor of our current period in world history is the rivalry between England and Germany. This rivalry must inevitably lead to an armed conflict between them, the outcome of which will likely be fatal for the defeated side. The interests of these two states are far too incompatible, and their simultaneous existence as great powers will, sooner or later, prove impossible.

Indeed, on one side stands an island nation whose global significance rests on its dominion over the seas, world trade, and countless colonies. On the other side stands a powerful continental power whose limited territory is insufficient for its growing population. Therefore, Germany has directly and openly declared that its future lies on the seas, has developed enormous world trade with miraculous speed, and built a formidable navy to protect it. With its famous "Made in Germany" mark, Germany has created a mortal danger to its rival's industrial and economic well-being.

Naturally, England cannot surrender without a fight, and a life-and-death struggle between it and Germany is inevitable. The impending armed conflict resulting from this rivalry cannot possibly be reduced to a duel between England and Germany. Their forces are too unequal, and at the same time, they are insufficiently vulnerable to each other.

Germany can incite rebellion in India, South America, and especially a dangerous uprising in Ireland, paralyze English maritime trade through privateering, and perhaps submarine warfare, thereby creating food supply difficulties for Great Britain. However, despite the boldness of German military leaders, they would hardly risk a landing in England unless a lucky chance helps them destroy or significantly weaken the English navy.

As for England, Germany is completely invulnerable to it. All that is accessible to England is to seize German colonies, halt German maritime trade, and, in the most favorable case, destroy the German navy, but nothing more--and this alone cannot force the opponent to make peace. Therefore, England will undoubtedly try to resort to its previously successful means and decide on armed intervention only after securing the participation of strategically stronger powers on its side.

Since Germany, in turn, will certainly not remain isolated, the future Anglo-German war will transform into an armed conflict between two groups of powers: one following German orientation and the other English.

## It Is Difficult to Discern Any Real Benefits Russia Has Gained from Its Rapprochement with England

### Until the Russo-Japanese War

Russian policy adhered to neither orientation. Since the reign of Emperor Alexander III, Russia had been in a defensive alliance with France, one solid enough to ensure joint action by both states in case of an attack on either one, but not so close as to obligate them to necessarily support with armed force all political actions and demands of the ally.

Simultaneously, the Russian court maintained traditionally friendly relations, based on family ties, with Berlin. Thanks to this configuration, peace between the great powers remained undisturbed for many years, despite the abundance of combustible material in Europe. France was protected from German attack by its alliance with Russia, Germany was protected from French revanchist aspirations by Russia's proven peacefulness and friendship, and Russia was protected from excessive Austro-Hungarian machinations in the Balkan Peninsula by Germany's need to maintain good neighborly relations with it.

Finally, isolated England, restrained by rivalry with Russia in Persia, traditional English diplomatic fears of our offensive movements toward India, and poor relations with France (particularly evident during the famous Fashoda incident), watched the strengthening of German naval power with alarm yet hesitated to take active measures.

The Russo-Japanese War fundamentally changed the relationships between the great powers and brought England out of its isolated position. Throughout the Russo-Japanese War, England and America maintained a favorable neutrality toward Japan, while we enjoyed equally benevolent neutrality from France and Germany. This would seem to have been the seed of the most natural political combination for us.

However, after the war, our diplomacy made a sharp turn and definitively set a course for rapprochement with England. France was drawn into England's political orbit, forming the Triple Entente group with predominant English influence, and a collision with the powers grouping around Germany became, sooner or later, inevitable.

What advantages did we expect from abandoning our traditional policy of distrust toward England and breaking our tested, if not friendly, then neighborly relations with Germany? Looking somewhat carefully and examining the events that occurred after the Portsmouth Treaty, it is difficult to discern any real benefits we have gained from rapprochement with England. The only plus--improved relations with Japan--can hardly be considered a consequence of Russian-English rapprochement.

In essence, Russia and Japan are created to live in peace, as they have absolutely nothing to divide. All of Russia's properly understood tasks in the Far East are fully compatible with Japan's interests. These tasks are essentially limited to very modest bounds. A too broad flight of fantasy by overzealous executors, which had no foundation in actual state interests on one side, and the excessive nervousness and sensitivity of Japan, which mistakenly took these fantasies for a consistently implemented plan on the other side, caused a collision that more skillful diplomacy could have avoided.

Russia needs neither Korea nor even Port Arthur. Access to the open sea is undoubtedly useful, but the sea itself is not a market; it is merely a route for more advantageous delivery of goods to consuming markets. Meanwhile, in our Far East, we have not and will not for a long time have valuables promising any significant profits from their export. There are no markets there for our exports. We cannot count on broadly supplying our export goods to either developed America (industrially and agriculturally), nor poor and also industrial Japan, nor even coastal China and more distant markets, where our exports would inevitably meet with goods from industrially stronger competing powers.

What remains is inner China, with which our trade is conducted primarily by land. Thus, an open port would contribute more to the import of foreign goods to us than to the export of our domestic products. On the other hand, Japan, whatever may be said, does not covet our Far Eastern possessions. The Japanese are by nature a southern people, and the harsh conditions of our Far Eastern region cannot tempt them.

It is known that even in Japan itself, the northern Yezo is sparsely populated; Japanese colonization is proceeding unsuccessfully even in the southern part of Sakhalin that was ceded to Japan by the Portsmouth Treaty. Having taken Korea and Formosa, Japan is unlikely to go further north, and its aspirations will likely be directed toward the Philippine Islands, Indochina, Java, Sumatra, and Borneo. At most, what it might strive for is to acquire, purely for commercial reasons, some further sections of the Manchurian railway.

In short, *peaceful coexistence*--I will say more--*close rapprochement* between Russia and Japan in the Far East is entirely natural, regardless of any English mediation. The ground for agreement suggests itself. Japan is not a wealthy country; maintaining both a strong army and a powerful fleet simultaneously is difficult for it.

Its island position pushes it toward strengthening specifically its naval power. An alliance with Russia would allow it to focus all its attention on the fleet, which is necessary given its already emerging rivalry with America, while leaving the protection of its interests on the mainland to Russia. On the other hand, we, having the Japanese fleet for naval defense of our Pacific coast, would be able to abandon our unrealistic dream of creating a navy in the Far East.

Thus, in terms of relations with Japan, rapprochement with England has brought us no real benefit. It has given us nothing in terms of strengthening our position in Manchuria, Mongolia, or even in the Uriankhai region, where the uncertainty of our position testifies that agreement with England has, in any case, not freed our diplomacy's hands. On the contrary, our attempt to establish relations with Tibet met with sharp resistance from England.

Our position in Persia has not changed for the better since the agreement. Everyone remembers our predominant influence in that country under Shah Nasr-ed-Din during the period of greatest tension in our relations with England. From the moment of rapprochement with the larivalry with America, while leaving the protection of its interests on the mainland to Russia.

From the moment of rapprochement with the latter, we found ourselves involved in a series of incomprehensible attempts to impose on the Persian population a constitution that was completely unnecessary for them, contributing to the overthrow of a monarch loyal to Russia.

In short, we not only gained nothing, but on the contrary, lost all along the line, destroying both our prestige and many millions of rubles, and even the precious blood of Russian soldiers, treacherously murdered and, to please England, not even avenged.

But the most negative consequences of rapprochement with England--and consequently a fundamental divergence with Germany--have manifested in the Near East. As is known, Bismarck once made the famous statement that for Germany the Balkan question was not worth the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier.

Subsequently, Balkan complications began to attract incomparably more attention from German diplomacy, which took the "sick man" under its protection, but even then Germany long showed no inclination to risk relations with Russia over Balkan affairs. The proof is before us. Indeed, how easy it would have been for Austria, during the Russo-Japanese War and our subsequent turmoil, to realize its cherished aspirations in the Balkan Peninsula.

But Russia at that time had not yet tied its fate to England, and Austria-Hungary was forced to miss the most advantageous moment for its goals. However, it was enough for us to take the path of close rapprochement with England for the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to immediately follow--which could have been accomplished so easily and painlessly in 1905 or 1906--then the Albanian question arose and the combination with Prince Wied.

Russian diplomacy tried to answer Austrian intrigues by forming the Balkan League, but this combination proved completely ephemeral.

Under what conditions will this collision occur, and what will be its likely consequences? The basic groupings in the future war are obvious: Russia, France, and England on one side, Germany, Austria, and Turkey on the other. It is more than likely that other powers will also take part in the war, depending on the various conditions under which war breaks out. But whether the immediate cause of war is a new collision of opposing interests in the Balkans, or a colonial incident like Algeciras, the basic grouping will remain the same. Italy, if it properly understands its interests, will not side with Germany. Due to political and economic reasons, Italy undoubtedly strives to expand its current territory, which can only be achieved at the expense of Austria on one side and Turkey on the other. Therefore, it is natural that Italy will not side with those who guarantee the territorial integrity of the states at whose expense it wishes to realize its aspirations.

Moreover, the possibility is not excluded that Italy might join the anti-German coalition if the fortunes of war inclined in its favor, in order to secure for itself the most advantageous conditions for participation in the subsequent division of spoils. In this respect, Italy's position aligns with the probable position of Romania, which will likely remain neutral until the scales of fortune tip to one side or the other. Then, guided by healthy political egoism, it will join the victors to be rewarded either at Russia's expense or at Austria's. Among other Balkan states, Serbia and Montenegro will undoubtedly side against Austria, while Bulgaria and Albania (if it has not formed at least an embryo of a state) will side against Serbia. Greece will probably remain neutral or side against Turkey, but only when the outcome is more or less predetermined. The participation of other states will be incidental, and we should fear Sweden, which will naturally be among our opponents.

Under such conditions, a struggle with Germany presents enormous difficulties for us and will require incalculable sacrifices. The war will not catch the opponent off guard, and the degree of its preparedness will probably exceed our most exaggerated expectations. One should not think that this preparedness stems from Germany's own desire for war. War is unnecessary for it, as long as it could achieve its goal--ending sole dominion over the seas--without it. But since this vital goal meets opposition from the coalition, Germany will not retreat from war and will certainly try to provoke it, choosing the most advantageous moment for itself.

## THE MAIN BURDEN OF WAR WILL FALL ON RUSSIA

The main burden of war will undoubtedly fall on us, since England is hardly capable of broad participation in a continental war, while France, poor in human material, given the colossal losses that will accompany war under modern conditions of military technology, will probably adhere to strictly defensive tactics. The role of the battering ram, breaking through the very thickness of German defense, will fall to us, and yet how many factors will be against us and how much strength and attention we will have to spend on them. From these unfavorable factors, we should exclude the Far East. America and Japan, the first by essence and the second by virtue of its current political orientation, are both hostile to Germany, and there is no basis to expect them to side with it.

Moreover, the war, regardless of its outcome, will weaken Russia and divert its attention to the West, which serves Japanese and American interests. Therefore, our rear is sufficiently secured from the Far East, and at most they will extort from us some concessions of an economic nature for their benevolent neutrality. The possibility is not excluded of America or Japan joining the anti-German side, but of course only as seizers of one or another poorly defended German colony. On the other hand, an outbreak of hostility against us in Persia is certain, along with probable unrest among Muslims in the Caucasus and Turkestan, and the possibility of Afghanistan moving against us in connection with the latter. Finally, we should foresee very unpleasant complications in Poland and Finland.

In Finland, an uprising will inevitably break out if Sweden proves to be among our opponents. As for Poland, we should expect that we will not be able to hold it during the war. When it falls into the power of our opponents, they will undoubtedly attempt to provoke an uprising, which is not very dangerous for us but which we will still have to count among the unfavorable factors, especially since the influence of our allies may induce us to take steps in our relations with Poland that are more dangerous than any open uprising.

Are we prepared for such a stubborn struggle as the future war of European peoples will undoubtedly prove to be? To this question, one must, without equivocation, answer innfold. Our young legislative institutions are largely to blame for this insufficiency, having taken a dilettantish interest in our defense, but far from grasping the full seriousness of the political situation developing under the influence of the orientation which, with society's sympathetic attitude, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has followed in recent years.

Proof of this is the huge number of military and naval ministry bills remaining unconsidered, and in particular, the plan for organizing our state defense that was presented to the Duma under State Secretary Stolypin. Undisputedly, in the realm of troop training, we have, according to specialists, achieved substantial improvement compared to the time preceding the Japanese War. Our field artillery leaves nothing to be desired; the rifle is quite satisfactory; the equipment is comfortable and practical. However, it is also undisputed that there are essential deficiencies in our defense organization.

In this regard, we must first note the inadequacy of our military supplies, which cannot be blamed on the military department, since the planned procurement programs are far from fully implemented due to the low productivity of our factories. This insufficiency of ammunition supplies is significant because, given the embryonic state of our industry, we will not have the ability during the war to make up for identified shortfalls by domestic means. Furthermore, with both the Baltic and Black Seas closed to us, the import of defense items we lack from abroad will prove impossible.

Additionally, an unfavorable circumstance for our defense is its excessive dependence on foreign industry, which, combined with the cessation of any convenient foreign communications, will create a series of difficulties that are hard to overcome. The quantity of heavy artillery we have is far from sufficient, as proven by the experience of the Japanese War, and we have few machine guns. We have barely begun organizing our fortress defense, and even the Revel fortress, which protects access to the capital, is not yet complete. The network of strategic railways is insufficient, and the railways possess rolling stock that may be adequate for normal traffic but is inadequate for the colossal demands that will be placed on us in case of a European war. Finally, we should not lose sight of the fact that in the upcoming war, the most cultured, technically developed nations will be fighting. Every war has invariably been accompanied until now by new developments in military technology, and the technical backwardness of our industry does not create favorable conditions for us to adopt new inventions.

## GERMANY'S AND RUSSIA'S VITAL INTERESTS NOWHERE COLLIDE

All these factors are hardly being given due consideration by our diplomacy, whose conduct toward Germany is not devoid, to a certain degree, of even some aggressiveness that could excessively hasten the moment of armed collision with Germany, which, given the English orientation, is essentially inevitable.

But is this orientation correct, and does even a favorable period of war promise us such advantages that would compensate for all the difficulties and sacrifices inevitable in an exceptionally intense war?

The vital interests of Russia and Germany nowhere collide and provide a complete basis for peaceful coexistence between these two states. Germany's future lies on the seas, that is, where Russia, essentially the most continental of all the great powers, has no interests.

We have no overseas colonies and probably never will, and communication between different parts of the empire is easier by land than by sea. We do not feel an excess of population requiring territorial expansion, but even from the point of view of new conquests, what can victory over Germany give us?

Poznań, East Prussia? But why do we need these areas, densely populated by Poles, when we already have difficulty managing Russian Poles? Why revive centrifugal aspirations, not yet extinct in the Vistula region, by bringing into the Russian state restless Poznań and East Prussian Poles, whose national demands even the firmer German authority, compared to Russian, cannot suppress?

## IN THE REALM OF ECONOMIC INTERESTS, RUSSIAN BENEFITS AND NEEDS DO NOT CONTRADICT GERMAN ONES

| Region                  | Potential Acquisitions                    | Notes                                                                                      |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transcaucasus          | Armenian-populated areas                  | Desirable due to revolutionary sentiments and dreams of a great Armenia. |
| Persia                 | Economic and territorial expansion        | Interests do not collide with Germany. |
| Kashgaria              | Economic and territorial expansion        | Interests do not collide with Germany. |
| Urianhai region        | Economic and territorial expansion        | Interests do not collide with Germany. |
| Vistula region         | Areas of little value, poorly suited for colonization | Polish-Lithuanian population is restless and hostile to Germans. |
| Baltic provinces       | Areas of little value, poorly suited for colonization | Latvian-Estonian population is equally restless and hostile to Germans. |

But one might object that territorial acquisitions, under modern conditions of national life, take second place and economic interests come to the fore. However, even in this realm, Russian benefits and needs hardly contradict German ones as much as is commonly thought. It is beyond doubt that the current Russian-German trade treaties are disadvantageous for our agriculture and advantageous for German agriculture, but it is hardly correct to attribute this circumstance to Germany's cunning and unfriendliness.

We should not lose sight of the fact that these treaties are advantageous to us in many of their parts. The Russian delegates who concluded these treaties at the time were convinced supporters of developing Russian industry at whatever cost and, undoubtedly, consciously sacrificed, at least partially, the interests of Russian agriculture in favor of Russian industry's interests.

Furthermore, we must not lose sight of the fact that Germany itself is far from being a direct consumer of most items of our agricultural foreign exports. For most products of our agricultural industry, Germany is only an intermediary, and consequently, it depends on us and the consuming markets to establish direct relations and thereby avoid expensive German intermediation.

Finally, it is necessary to consider that the conditions of trade relations can change depending on the conditions of political coexistence between the contracting states, since no country benefits from the economic weakening of an ally, but conversely benefits from the ruin of a political opponent.

In short, although it is undoubtedly true that the current Russian-German trade treaties are disadvantageous for us and that Germany, in concluding them, successfully exploited circumstances that developed favorably for it--that is, simply put, squeezed us--this behavior cannot be counted as hostile and is a worthy-of-emulation act of healthy national egoism, which could not have been unexpected from Germany and which should have been taken into account.

In any case, we see in Austria-Hungary an agricultural country in incomparably greater economic dependence on Germany than we are, which nevertheless does not prevent it from achieving such development in agriculture as we can only dream about. Given all the above, concluding a trade treaty with Germany that is fully acceptable for Russia would seem to not at all require Germany's prior defeat. Good neighborly relations with it, thoughtful weighing of our real economic interests in various branches of the national economy, and long persistent bargaining with German delegates, who are undoubtedly called to protect the interests of their, not our, fatherland, are quite sufficient.**Economic Relations with Germany: Analysis and Recommendations**

Germany's actions, which successfully exploited circumstances that developed favorably for it--squeezing us in the process--cannot be counted as hostile. This behavior exemplifies a worthy act of healthy national egoism, which, while not unexpected from Germany, should have been taken into account.

In any case, we observe that Austria-Hungary, an agricultural country with incomparably greater economic dependence on Germany than we have, nevertheless achieves agricultural development that we can only dream about. Given this context, concluding a trade treaty with Germany that is fully acceptable to Russia does not necessarily require Germany's prior defeat. Good neighborly relations, thoughtful consideration of our real economic interests across various branches of the national economy, and prolonged negotiations with German delegates--who are undoubtedly tasked with protecting the interests of their own country--are quite sufficient.

I will elaborate: Germany's defeat in terms of our trade exchange would be disadvantageous for us. Such a defeat would likely culminate in a peace dictated by England's economic interests. England would exploit the situation to the fullest extent, and in a devastated Germany that has lost its sea routes, we would lose a valuable consumer market for our products, which have no other outlet.

Regarding Germany's economic future, the interests of Russia and England are directly opposed to one another. It is advantageous for England to undermine German maritime trade and industry, reducing Germany to a poor agricultural country if possible. Conversely, it is in our interest for Germany to develop its maritime trade and the industries that support it, thereby opening its internal market to our agricultural products to supply its numerous working population.

However, independent of trade treaties, there are concerns regarding the dominance of German influence in Russian economic life and the systematic implementation of German colonization, which is purportedly a clear danger to the Russian state. These fears, however, seem largely exaggerated. The infamous Drang nach Osten was a natural and understandable phenomenon at the time, as Germany's territory could not accommodate its growing population, which was pushed toward the direction of least resistance--namely, into the less densely populated neighboring countries.

The German government was compelled to acknowledge the inevitability of this movement but could hardly see it as serving its interests. After all, German citizens were departing the sphere of German statehood, thereby diminishing their country's living strength. Of course, the German government made every effort to maintain the settlers' connection with their former homeland and even allowed the possibility of dual citizenship.

Nonetheless, it is undeniable that a significant number of German emigrants ultimately settled permanently and irrevocably in their new locations, gradually severing ties with their homeland. This situation, clearly unaligned with Germany's state interests, likely motivated it to pursue a path of colonial policy and maritime trade, which was previously foreign to it.

As German colonies proliferate and German industry and maritime trade develop in connection with them, the wave of German colonists is receding. The day is not far off when the Drang nach Osten will become a matter of historical memory.

In any case, German colonization, which undoubtedly contradicts our state interests, must be halted, and friendly relations with Germany do not preclude this action. Advocating for a preference for German orientation does not imply endorsing Russia's vassal dependency on Germany. While maintaining friendly, neighborly ties with Germany, we must not sacrifice our state interests for this goal.

Germany itself would likely not object to efforts aimed at curtailing the further influx of German colonists into Russia. It is more advantageous for Germany to direct the wave of migration to its colonies. Furthermore, even in the absence of colonies and when German industry did not fully employ the population, the German government did not protest against the restrictive measures instituted during Alexander III's reign regarding foreign colonization.

Regarding German dominance in our economic life, this phenomenon hardly warrants the reproaches typically directed at it. Russia is too impoverished in both capital and industrial enterprise to manage without a broad influx of foreign capital. Thus, some dependence on foreign capital is inevitable until our industrial capabilities and the material means of the population develop sufficiently to eliminate the need for foreign entrepreneurs and their investments.

While we require foreign capital, German capital is more advantageous for us than any other option. Primarily, this capital is the least expensive, as it demands lower rates of entrepreneurial profit. This largely accounts for the comparative affordability of German products and their gradual displacement of English goods from the global market.

The lower profitability expectations associated with German capital allow it to enter ventures that other foreign investments might avoid due to relatively low profitability. Consequently, the influx of German capital into Russia results in smaller outflows of entrepreneurial profits compared to English and French capital, thus retaining more Russian rubles within the country.

Moreover, a significant portion of the profits generated by German capital invested in Russian industry does not leave Russia but is reinvested domestically. Unlike English or French capitalists, German capitalists tend to move to Russia along with their investments. This characteristic explains the notable presence of German industrialists, factory owners, and manufacturers compared to their English and French counterparts. The latter typically remain abroad, extracting profits from Russia without reinvesting in the country. In contrast, German entrepreneurs often reside in Russia for extended periods and frequently settle there permanently.

Even if we acknowledge the necessity of eradicating German dominance in our economic life--perhaps even at the cost of completely expelling German capital from Russian industry--it seems that such measures could be enacted without resorting to war with Germany.

The costs associated with such a war would far exceed any dubious benefits we might gain from liberation from German dominance. Moreover, the aftermath of this war would create an economic situation where the burden of German capital would feel light by comparison. It is beyond doubt that the war would necessitate expenditures that exceed Russia's limited financial resources, forcing us to seek credit from allied and neutral states, which would not be granted freely.

The potential consequences of an unsuccessful war are dire. The financial and economic ramifications of defeat cannot be calculated or foreseen and would likely lead to the complete collapse of our national economy. Even a victory would yield unfavorable financial prospects: a thoroughly devastated Germany would be unable to compensate us for our incurred costs. A peace treaty dictated by England's interests would prevent Germany from recovering sufficiently to cover our military expenses in the future. Any resources we might manage to extract would need to be shared with our allies, resulting in a meager portion for us compared to our military expenditures.

Additionally, the repayment of war loans would come under pressure from our allies. After the collapse of German power, our significance to them would diminish. Furthermore, our enhanced political power due to victory may prompt them to undermine us economically. Thus, even after a victorious conclusion to the war, we might find ourselves in a financial predicament with our creditors, making our current dependence on German capital seem ideal by comparison.

However bleak the economic prospects presented by an alliance with England and, consequently, a war with Germany may appear, they remain secondary to the political consequences of this fundamentally unnatural alliance.

The conflict between Russia and Germany is deeply undesirable for both nations, as it undermines the monarchist principle that both represent in the civilized world, standing in opposition to the democratic principle embodied elsewhere.will have to be paid, not without pressure from our allies. After all, after the collapse of German power, we will no longer be needed by them. Moreover, our political might, increased due to victory, will induce them to weaken us, at least economically. Thus, inevitably, even after a victorious conclusion to the war, we will find ourselves in a state of financial bondage to our creditors, compared to which our current dependence on German capital will seem ideal.

The struggle between Russia and Germany is deeply undesirable for both sides, as it amounts to weakening the monarchist principle.

We should not lose sight of the fact that Russia and Germany represent the conservative principle in the civilized world, which stands in opposition to the democratic principle embodied by England and, to a far lesser degree, France.

However strange it may seem, England, monarchist and conservative to the core at home, has always acted externally as the patron of the most demagogic aspirations, invariably indulging all popular movements aimed at weakening the monarchist principle.

From this perspective, the struggle between Germany and Russia, regardless of its outcome, is deeply undesirable for both sides, as it undoubtedly amounts to weakening the global conservative principle, for which these two great powers serve as the only reliable bulwark.

Moreover, one cannot help but foresee that, under the exceptional conditions of the approaching general European war, this war, again regardless of its outcome, will present a mortal danger for both Russia and Germany.

Based on a deep conviction formed through careful, many-year study of all contemporary anti-state currents, a social revolution will inevitably break out in the defeated country, which, by force of circumstances, will spread to the victorious country.

The channels by which both countries have been invisibly connected over many years of peaceful coexistence are too numerous for fundamental social upheavals occurring in one of them not to be reflected in the other.

That these upheavals will be specifically social rather than political in character--there can be no doubt, and this applies not only to Russia but also to Germany.

Russia presents an especially favorable ground for social upheavals, where the masses undoubtedly lean toward the principles of unconscious socialism.

Despite the oppositional nature of Russian society, as unconscious as the socialism of the broad strata of the population may be, political revolution in Russia is impossible, and any revolutionary movement will inevitably degenerate into a socialist revolution.

The Russian commoner, be they peasant or worker, does not seek political rights, which are both unnecessary and incomprehensible to him.

The peasant dreams of being freely granted someone else's land, while the worker longs to receive all the capitalist's capital and profits, and their aspirations do not extend beyond this.

If the government were to deny them support and leave elections to their natural course, the legislative institutions would not see within their very walls a single intellectual, aside from a few agitator-demagogues.

However, members of our legislative institutions might proclaim the people's trust in them; the peasant would sooner believe a landless government official than a landowner-Octobrist sitting in the Duma.

It is more than strange, under such conditions, to demand that governmental authority seriously reckon with the opposition, for its sake abandon the role of impartial regulator of social relations, and present itself before the broad popular masses as an obedient organ of the class aspirations of the intellectual-propertied minority of the population.

By demanding from governmental authority responsibility before class representation and obedience to an artificially created parliament, our opposition essentially demands from the government the psychology of a savage who crafts an idol with his own hands and then worships it with trepidation.

## RUSSIA WILL BE PLUNGED INTO HOPELESS ANARCHY, WHOSE OUTCOME IS DIFFICULT TO FORESEE

If the war ends victoriously, suppressing the socialist movement will ultimately not present insurmountable difficulties.

There will be agrarian disturbances based on agitation for the necessity of rewarding soldiers with additional land allotments, and there will be labor unrest in transitioning from the probably elevated wartime wages to normal rates--and one must hope it will be limited to this, until the wave of German social revolution reaches us.

But in case of failure, the possibility of which, in struggling with such an opponent as Germany, cannot be ignored--social revolution in its most extreme manifestations is inevitable for us.

A furious campaign against the government will begin in legislative institutions, resulting in revolutionary outbursts in the country.

These latter will immediately advance socialist slogans, the only ones that can raise and group together broad strata of the population--first land redistribution, and then general division of all valuables and properties.

The defeated army, having lost, moreover, during the war its most reliable cadre composition, captured largely by the general peasant aspiration for land, will prove too demoralized to serve as a bulwark of law and order.

The totality of all the above leads to the conclusion that rapprochement with England promises us no benefits, and the English orientation of our diplomacy is fundamentally mistaken in its essence. We have no common path with England; it should be left to its fate, and we need not quarrel with Germany over it.

## The Triple Entente

In this direction, and not in the fruitless seeking of ground for agreement with England that contradicts our state views and goals by its very essence, all efforts of our diplomacy should be concentrated. Germany must meet our aspirations to restore tested friendly-allied relations with it and work out, in closest agreement with us, conditions for our coexistence that would not give ground for anti-German agitation from our constitutional-liberal parties, which by their very nature are forced to adhere not to conservative-German, but to liberal-English orientation.
